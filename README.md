## Introduction

Welcome to the Zero Trust Repository, where we gather comprehensive information about the Zero Trust security model. Zero Trust is a critical approach to cybersecurity that assumes that threats can come from both outside and inside the network. This repository serves as a central hub for various resources, including articles, presentations, documentation, diagrams, and more related to Zero Trust.

## About Zero Trust

Zero Trust is a cybersecurity framework that challenges the traditional notion of perimeter security. It operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify." In a Zero Trust model, trust is never assumed, and every user, device, or application must continuously authenticate and authorize to access resources. 

To learn more about Zero Trust, check out our [Wiki](wiki/zero-trust.md).
